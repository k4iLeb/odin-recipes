This is my first project on ODIN based purely on HTML

I used the following skills/knowledge to create it:

- Create directories/files using CLI
- Open the project in VSCode using CLI
- Create GitHub repo and clone it with SSH using CLI locally on my machine
- Create index.html and a directory for the recipes
- Create recipes' files and linked them in index.html
- Use anchors, images, ordered lists, unordered lists, paragraphs and basic HTML elements to create the project
- Commit all changes with correct commit messages using text editor messages
- Push project to GitHub
