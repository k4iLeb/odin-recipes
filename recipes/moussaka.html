    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Moussaka is a traditional Mediterranean dish made with layers of eggplant,
      spiced minced meat (often beef or lamb), and a creamy béchamel sauce,
      baked to golden perfection. Rich in flavor and hearty, it’s a beloved
      comfort food that embodies the essence of Greek cuisine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped summer savory (chubritsa)</li>
      <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
      <li>⅔ cup yogurt</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground
        beef in hot oil until crumbly and evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season
        with paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in potatoes and cook for 2
        to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce and summer savory. Pour in enough
        water to just barely cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour meat mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and spread evenly. Mix
        together yogurt and beaten egg in a small bowl; spread over meat mixture
        to cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 30 to 40
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
